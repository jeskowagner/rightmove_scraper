## Rightmove scraper

This tool was built to gather results from the Rightmove housing website, which has many offers but not quick-to-skim overview of their offers. The aim of this tool is to change exactly that: simply take a search from Rightmove with your search parameters, copy & paste the URL of that search into the program, select an output file, and wait a few minutes for the results to be aggregated.

## Legal

Programatically extracting data from Rightmove is against their Terms of Service. Note that this does not mean use of this tool is illegal, but instead Rightmove could ban you from using their site. Either way, because of this reason this tool is meant purely for educational purposes.
